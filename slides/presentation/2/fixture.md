# Fixture

<Text>
In Playwright, a fixture is a mechanism for setting up and tearing down a specific test environment before and after a series of tests. Fixtures help create a consistent starting point for tests, providing a predefined state for the browser context or page. This ensures that tests run in a controlled environment, enhancing reproducibility and reliability in automated testing scenarios.
