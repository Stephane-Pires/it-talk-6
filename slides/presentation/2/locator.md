# Locators

<Text>
In Playwright, a locator serves as a means to identify and interact with HTML elements on a webpage through methods like CSS selectors or XPath. It is a fundamental tool in test automation, enabling scripts to precisely target and manipulate specific elements, such as buttons or input fields. By using locators, Playwright facilitates efficient and reliable automation of interactions with web elements during testing.
