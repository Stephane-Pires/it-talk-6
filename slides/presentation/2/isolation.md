# Isolation

<Text>
In Playwright, isolation is achieved through browser contexts, which represent independent, incognito-like sessions. Each context operates in isolation, preventing shared data such as cookies or caches between different contexts. This isolation is instrumental in parallel test execution, maintaining test independence, and ensuring consistent and reliable results.
